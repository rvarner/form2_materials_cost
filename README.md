# form2\_materials\_cost
Automatically logs into FormLabs and adds the materials cost to the notes field of each print.

Uses [Geb](http://www.google.com) and [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org), so you get to kick back and watch it work for you.


## Installation
You need to have [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) installed.

Once Java is installed, go into the **form2\_materials\_cost** directory and type:

```
./gradlew run
```
