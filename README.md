# form2\_materials\_cost
Automatically logs into FormLabs and adds the materials cost to the notes field of each print.

Uses [Geb](http://www.google.com) and [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org), so you get to kick back and watch it work for you.


## Installation

## Run
Once Java is installed, ```cd form2_materials_cost/``` and type:
